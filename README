gtk-sharp-beans binds some API from Gtk+ that isn't in Gtk# 2.12.x
but is needed for full GIO and other misc support.  It exists as a stop-gap
measure until Gtk# 3.0 is released with more complete bindings of recent API.

It is not installed in the GAC because we are not ready to commit to API
stability.  Please follow

http://www.mono-project.com/Guidelines:Application_Deployment#Libraries_with_Unstable_APIs

for how to use this library in your application.
